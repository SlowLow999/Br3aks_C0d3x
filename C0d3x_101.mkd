We all know what's **jailbreaking**. ***but what about LLMs?*** (aka Large Language Model)

Jailbreaking LLMs is much easier than what you might think, in fact. most of the **Jailbreaks** (more correctly,  Prompt injections) only uses **natural language**. Which puts the learning bar very low. and that's why Br3aks_C0d3x is here. To truly make that accessible!

A lot of people decide to learn prompt injection and jailbreaking using dedicated platforms (e.g. hackaprompt). but personally, I believe that the best place to learn isn't going to be in a *playground*. it's in the *battlefield*...

That's how I learned. and that's how you will learn here. at "Br3aks_C0d3x". in the battlefield. and the stronger you are, the harder will the battlefield...

But the battlefield rules are different, Instead of asking you to build a weapon (=jailbreak) step by step, you'll be *given* a weapon and you'll **learn how it works**, and **how to produce it**, and finally. Build your ***own***

So let's start your journey! and we will begin by your first battlefield: [Mistral](level1-mistral.mkd)
